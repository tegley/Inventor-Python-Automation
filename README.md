### Vessel Saddle Generation Coding Project
#### - Collects user input in the form of vessel diameter, thickness, and length
#### - Sketches apporpriately sized vessel diameter as a circle on the 2D plane
#### - Constrains a line of desired length to the circle tangentially
#### - Uses extrusions to achieve desired thickness 
#### - Saves created component as a part file
##
### BOM Automation Coding Project
#### - Connects to active Inventor Assembly file
#### - Analyzes technical data from each of the parts in the assembly file 
#### - Accesses iProperties for sizing and quantity data
#### - Calculates the area of plate parts and the schedule of pipe components
#### - Reformats the Part Description according to company standards
#### - Fills out the Bill of Materials on the currently open Drawing file with this data 
#### - Exports data to desired material requisition Excel file
